##Philipp Müller
I am a Philosophy student from Germany. After attending the Emmanuel School of Mission in Rome English is running havoc in my head. With this blog I express myself and my thoughts on a wide variety of subjects from Ethics and Natural Theology, to the Theology of the Body and church life today.
